    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 10, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        StackDevOps8999 ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Military Federal Retirement Planner mobile application
        (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Military Federal Retirement Planner is designed with your privacy as a top priority. We want to be clear:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT collect any personal information</li>
        <li>We do NOT track your usage or behavior</li>
        <li>We do NOT transmit your data to our servers</li>
        <li>We do NOT share your information with third parties</li>
        <li>We do NOT use analytics or advertising services</li>
        <li>We do NOT require you to create an account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
    <p>
        All retirement calculations, profile information, and financial data you enter into the App are stored
        <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal profile information (name, dates, service details)</li>
        <li>Salary and compensation data</li>
        <li>Retirement calculation inputs and results</li>
        <li>Family member profiles</li>
        <li>Any notes or saved calculations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your data remains on your device and is never uploaded to external servers or cloud storage unless you
        explicitly choose to back up your device through your operating system's backup features (iCloud, Google Drive, etc.).
    </p>

    <h2>Backend Server Communication</h2>
    <p>
        The App connects to our backend server hosted on Railway.app solely to retrieve:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Current federal and military pay tables</li>
        <li>VA disability compensation rates</li>
        <li>TRICARE premium rates</li>
        <li>Thrift Savings Plan formulas</li>
        <li>Social Security benefit formulas</li>
        <li>Federal and State tax rates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These requests do NOT include any of your personal information or calculation data. The server only provides
        reference data needed for accurate calculations.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your device's security features (passcode, biometric authentication)</li>
        <li>Your device's operating system security</li>
        <li>Physical security of your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We recommend enabling device encryption and security features provided by your phone's operating system.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You have complete control over your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual profiles within the App</li>
        <li>Clear all data using the App's reset function</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App to remove all data from your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since we don't store your data on our servers, there is no data for us to delete on our end.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 17. We do not store information nor do we knowingly collect information
        from children. The App is designed for adults planning their retirement benefits.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and on this page.
        The "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only
        external connection is to our backend server for retrieving public pay table data, tax rates, and estimated retirement planning formulas.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since we don't collect or store your personal information on our servers, traditional data rights
        (access, correction, deletion requests) don't apply in the usual sense. You have direct control over all
        your data through the App interface on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have certain rights regarding their
        personal information. However, since we do not collect, store, or share your personal information, there is
        no data for us to provide, delete, or manage.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
        The App is designed primarily for U.S. military personnel, veterans, and federal employees. However, users
        from any location can use the App. Regardless of your location, we do not collect or transmit your personal data.
